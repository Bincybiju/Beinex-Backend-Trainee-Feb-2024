1     Write python programs , which accept two inputs and perform the following arithmetic operations
	i)    Addition (+)
        ii)   Subtraction (-)
        iii)  Multiplication (*)
        iv)   Division (/)
        v)    Modulus (%)
        vi)   Exponentiation (**)
        vii)  Floor Division (//)  
2    Python Program to replicate bank transaction: min balance 500, ask user to the amount to withdraw, 
     print the balance amount after withdrawal, if user enters an amount greater than balance: print:: insufficient balance. 
     if balance is below 500 print an alert message : your account balance is "available_balance", Please  keep your account balance above Rs.500 to avoid unwanted charges.
3    Print the greatest of the 3 numbers taken as input, print equal if all three numbers are the same
4    Python program to check the number taken as an input is even or odd,print invalide input if user enters anything other than integers
5    Python program to check the score from a student ,print grades as A+ if score >= 90,A if 80 or above, B+ if 70 or above and so on... 
     print failed if the score is below 50, if score > 100 print invalid
6    Python program to print all even/odd numbers in the range given by user
7    Python program to print the multiplication table of any number (number should be taken as input and user decides the end limit of the table)
8    Find the factorial of a number taken as input using for loop
9    Find the factorial of a number taken as input using while loop
10    Find the sum of all even numbers between the range given by user
11   Find the sum of all odd numbers between the rane given by user using while loop
12   Print first 10 fibonacci numbers using 'for' and 'while' loops
13   print the following patterns
